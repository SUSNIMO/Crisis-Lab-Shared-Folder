HI guys, this is you code:

any code you guys modify or do will be placed on your own respective folders

this is how your folders are structured
your name folder/ (you place all your stuff here)
	Code folder/ (place all your code here) (there's a dummy code there so dw)

the rest is now up to you, you can make or delete or change anything WITHIN your
folder. Do not tamper with the other folders that are outside your name folder.

This way, we can prevent the loss or missarrangement of code

Thank you for complying :)
